          <h3>Review Process</h3>
          <p>
            Any submissions to the Maryland Undergraduate Research Journal will undergo a
            double-blind
            peer review process. This process consists of an initial screening followed by a
            formal
            review. The initial screening will identify submissions that best align with the
            journalâ€™s
            aims and scope; this step will be conducted by student reviewers. If successful,
            submissions
            will then be sent to a faculty reviewer, where they will undergo a formal review
            critically
            examining the content of the submission. Submissions that pass both the initial
            screening
            and the formal review will be published without the need for further action.
            Submissions
            with minor errors may need to undergo revision before publication. Unsuccessful
            submissions
            are encouraged to revise and resubmit.
